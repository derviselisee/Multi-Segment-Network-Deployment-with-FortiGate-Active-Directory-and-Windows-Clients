Multi Segment Network Deployment with FortiGate, Active Directory, and Windows Clients

This project recreates a small enterprise network environment using a FortiGate firewall, a Windows Server domain controller, and a Windows 10 workstation. 
The goal was to design a segmented network, secure traffic between segments, deploy Active Directory services, and monitor network activity through both the firewall and the server.

Project Overview

The lab includes two internal LAN segments connected through a FortiGate firewall.
LAN1 hosts a Windows 10 client.
LAN2 hosts a Windows Server running Active Directory Domain Services.

The project demonstrates skills in firewall configuration, Windows Server administration, traffic monitoring, routing, DHCP, DNS, and enterprise client connectivity.

What I Configured
1. Firewall Interfaces and Network Segmentation

Configured Port2 and Port3 on the FortiGate firewall as separate LAN interfaces.
Assigned addressing and enabled DHCP services on the interfaces to create two distinct network segments.

2. Firewall Policies and Internet Access

Created security policies to allow LAN to LAN communication and LAN to Internet traffic.
Verified NAT behavior and confirmed that both the Windows 10 workstation and the Windows Server could reach the internet.

3. Windows Server Domain Deployment

Installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services.
Created the domain, structured organizational units, and added multiple user accounts.

4. Windows 10 Domain Connectivity

Connected the Windows 10 workstation to the LAN1 segment.
Confirmed that the device received the correct DHCP configuration and successfully reached the domain controller in LAN2.

5. Traffic Monitoring and Log Analysis

Used FortiView and Forward Traffic logs on the FortiGate to observe real time sessions, network behavior, and application use from the Windows 10 machine.
Reviewed system and network logs on both Windows devices to validate routing, DNS resolution, authentication, and policy effects.
